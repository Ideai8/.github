We're a small but mighty technology studio that builds smart software solutions with AI.

Our team brings diverse experience in designing, building, and shipping products at various tech companies. Having founded technology startups in the past, we're bringing our experience together at Ideai8.

Right now, we’re focused on helping other builders — software engineers, designers, and tech folks — work more efficiently, get things done faster, and with less friction.
We make tools and products we’d want to use ourselves. Things that make work smoother, and a bit more fun!

AI is a big part of how we work. It's in our name after all (Ide-ai-8) :) We use it in our own processes, and the solutions we build are powered by AI too. Not for a sake of a hype, but in a way that makes sense and actually helps.

We believe in making small, thoughtful bets on promising ideas. We research, build, and test quickly, to decide whether to scale it up or move on to the next exciting challenge.

We publically share - how we operate, what we’re building, and what we’ve learnt (the wins and the failures). We think being open helps us grow and hope that it helps others too.
